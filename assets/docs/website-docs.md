# Full Website Documentation

Wellcome. I aim to document the process of creating and publishing this website as part of my educational project.

To get things started we must first learn how to host a website, there's many methods but for these kinds of projects I prefer github pages.

### Hosting a website on GitHub

Best documentation can be viewed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). I will only write a short summary of things I did.

Things we do for projects:
 - add gitignore for nodemodules and other unnecessary files
 - Click Initialize Repository in VSCode (or do it manually to feel like 5up3r l33t h4x0r)
 - continue with the first commit, just click the blue button a few more times
 - Open repository on github, go to settings, pages, change branch to main, wait for github to process the repo 

### Dynamic Content from JS

While real world example would use AJAX and an actual database here we must do with just an array and some copy pasted html
